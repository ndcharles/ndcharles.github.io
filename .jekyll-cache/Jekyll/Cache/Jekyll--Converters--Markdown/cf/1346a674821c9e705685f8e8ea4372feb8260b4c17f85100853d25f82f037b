<p><br />
Ok. Hear me out.</p>

<p>I am knowledged about digital marketing, web platforms and tech in general which makes me a good growth hacker marketer.</p>

<p>My engineering background and love for details led me to data science and analytics where I drill down data in search of meaning and hidden information.</p>

<p>Speaking of eye for details, digital marketing and tech, as a product manager I spend time analysing web platforms to understand how they work and, how users use them in order to know how platforms should actually work best for its users.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Data Analyst and also acting as a Product Manager. I often create email newsletters and online resources for our company’s blog.</p>

<p>In my own time I am a homeschool teacher for Common Entrance pupils and every other things (albeit in tech). I design <a href="https://opendiari.com/thatbros">WordPress websites</a>, <a href="https://opendiari.com">write quick tech articles</a>, and read daily about tech and growth marketing.</p>

<p>All of my writings on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#data">data science</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#growth">growth marketing</a>, <a href="#growth">product marketing</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#tech">tech_life</a> can be found under the <strong>Articles section</strong>. My data science portfolio is at the <strong>Portfolio section</strong> (or just go <a href="https://ndcharles.github.io/portfolio">here</a>. If you want to see all of the wonderful projects I’ve worked on (and still working on), head over to the <strong>Projects section</strong>.</p>

<p>I am a graduate of Agricultural and Bioresources Engineering. Was once a classroom teacher (Grade 6) where I spent the COVID period using online platforms to teach the kids. No platform was able to truly satisfy my classroom experience. I am currently building <strong>CommonEntranceHelp (CEH)</strong> by hacking together WordPress theme, plugins and other low-code resources as a playground to nurture my interest in edtech.</p>

<p>Join me by donating to the project, helping with teaching resources or contributing your tech skill.</p>

<p>You are highly appreciated when you do.</p>

<p>Talk Soon!</p>
