If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

+ **bold**
+ __italicize__
+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*

+ Add highlights <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% last_modified_at %}</code> this is cool (changes the font to a cooler one.
+ <span style="color:red">text to change</span> make a text change colour to red and retain the font.

This is a comment to ignore.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

# Stories to Help You Level-Up at Work

# Installing Ruby and Jekyll for Existing Website

After switching to a new PC I found it difficult getting my Jekyll site up again due to dependency issues.

Let me give you a run down of my Jekyll process.

First things first, install, ruby + devkit through here https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ 

Download the first option w/ devkit 

Run `ridk install` to install local dependencies
From the installations, select `MSYS2 and MINGW development tool chain` that's option 3.

Next Install Jekyll and Bundler using `gem install jekyll bundler`

Check if Jekyll has been installed properly: `jekyll -v`

Ref: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/

## To continue with existing jekyll site 
- Open command prompt and navigate to the project foler
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`
- Type `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to continue with your website
